# nWoD-db
Web app for creating new world of darkness characters and browsing character data (Mage spells, vampire disciplines merits, etc)


## To do
 1. Model References to 'character' should be changed to use Generic Foreign Keys
 2. Change nWoDCharacter to Characteristics, and use GFKs.
 3. Limit GFKs to playable templates
 3. Implement bulk upload of spell data
